		| 1           | 20  | In              |

	Then the list should be like this
		| Code | Name |  
	    | 2    | A    |
	    | 3    | B    |
		| 1    | C   |

		| 3           | 30  | In              |

Scenario:Getting max/min values of binary tree
	Given I have the following tree nodes
	    | NodeId | Value | Left | Right |
	    | 1      | 100   | 2    | 3     |
		| 2      | 200   | 4    | 5     |

		| 8      | 1     | 0    | 0     |

	   
	When get tree stats is called
	Then max value should be 340 and min value should be 1
